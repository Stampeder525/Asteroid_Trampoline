# Asteroid_Trampoline

Protect earth in this fast paced physics-based arcade game built in Unity3D! 
Deflect asteroids hurtling towards the planet with a massive interplanetary space trampoline. 
Bounce them into each other to destroy them, score points, and work up combos!

Move the mouse to control the trampoline in orbit around Earth. 
If surrounded by asteroids, press spacebar to clear the screen with a bomb, but be careful, as supplies are limited!
To restore lives, wait for health packs to fall to Earth. Take care not to bounce them away with your trampoline, however.
